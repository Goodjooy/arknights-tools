[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     W, we have a problem.
[name="W"]   Ho... For you to contact me on this channel. Why? What did you found that was interesting?
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     Not that interesting, W. One of the teams defected while you were reorganizing the Sarkaz mercenaries.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     I think it was a clean up team that was suppose to sweep up any leftovers from the battlefield, so we launched a chase.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     Surprisingly, they scattered, collapsing their team, and began to evacuate the city.
[name="W"]   Congratulations.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     But the unexpected thing is... The team we sent in pursuit lost contact with us.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     As the new leader of the mercenaries, I hope you can give me a reasonable explanation.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     Why did our team disappeared?

[name="W"]   Your kind of explanation is not good for my comprehension, you know?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     That's true. But the team found no ambushes or traps, only that the enemy was a Sarkaz.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   Of course it's Sarkaz. What other race are in my mercenary team? But that's interesting. Continue.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     At first contact, the target was successfully suppressed, and out of caution, the pursuit team held back since the other side was not a strong enemy.
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     At some point, however, communication was suddenly cut off.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   ... Well, it seems real beasts are better at hiding their fangs than you, you were too careless.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     What should we do now?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   What's the distinguishing feature of that Sarkaz?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]    ... I don't know much. Witnesses are mostly out of contact. From a distance, only one soldier was known to be in close combat.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   Don't confront them head on. Delay that person. I'll see you later.

[name="W"]   Nothing. It's one of the less mature teams has been baited.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Movement Swordman"]     Are we going to support them?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Alas, clearly everyone has their own work to do, why can't each of them deal with the matter of duty?
[name="W"]   Hmm... I won't go deep into the matter this time around. After all, I'm also very concerned about the strange Sarkaz that my poor former leader had with him.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Movement Swordman"]     Understood.

[name="W"]   It was worrying for a Sarkaz who had lived through that war to suddenly disappear.
[name="W"]   Mercenaries, just a change of leadership and then they want to run away, they're making people nervous.

[name="Flamebringer"]     But I must admit, tactics are a skill as well. If your tactics are better than what they used to be, I'd like to learn from you.

[name="W"]   Huh.

[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   At least I let go the people he was trying to protect.
[name="W"]   I promised him I would help the Rhodes Island rescue team——it doesn't contradict me killing him, I think?
[name="W"]   Besides, I had my own plan. The bait line had to be longer. But there was no reason to let him run, he was prey.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]

[name="Flamebringer"]     You're being incoherent.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   No, what I'm saying is, I may know something about the death of your old mercenary unit.
[name="W"]   Dear captain of the sword division, who plotted that conspiracy to make you the person you are now, maybe that is where you need to go?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Is that so?
[name="Flamebringer"]     Is that so...
[name="Flamebringer"]     Interesting.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#5",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Aha, so you don't know! Of course, I just found out about it.
[name="W"]   You will soon discover that things are not as simple as you think.
[name="W"]   I am looking forward to what you will do, hehe, you will always do something.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#5",name2="char_1011_wizard_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Movement Caster"]     W! How long will you wait? ?
[Character(name="char_131_flameb_5")]
[name="Flamebringer"]     ...
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#1")]
[name="W"]   Oh, seriously, my Sarkazian don't know how to just do it? If you need the work done. Do it yourself.
[name="W"]   Swordmaster - no, Flamebringer, you may die in the battle that follows.

[name="Flamebringer"]     It's been a long awaited time for a game of death. I'm excited.
[name="W"]   Long awaited? So maybe the demise of your mercenary squad didn't make you colder, but made you joyful instead?
[name="Flamebringer"]     我和你没有相像之处，W，快乐不是值得追求的目标。
[name="Flamebringer"]     "Last time" made me lose a lot of things, but the road before me has become clearer.
[name="Flamebringer"]     This time, I hope you don't disappoint me.
[name="W"]   You're laughing.
[name="W"]   If I say I'll spare your life this time, do you believe me?
[name="Flamebringer"]     I, want to ask that as well.

[name="Dobermann"]     Contract content——it doesn't seem to require you to confront the Reunion Movement before you actually get on board of Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     It's for my personal reason.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     We welcome those who are infected and those who are interested in solving the problem of infected people, but we will never accept those who violate the rules and regulations.
[name="Dobermann"]     Since we don't know what actually happened at the time, we won't take it into account.
[name="Dobermann"]     Just this once.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     If necessary, I accept handling of your way.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     We've taken care of that. Your motives and personal aspirations, we won't take it into account——let's be clear.
[name="Dobermann"]     If we judge you to be an unacceptable person to Rhodes Island, even if you are noble and honest, we cannot afford to let you off the hook.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Yes, it's just my personal request.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Well, we'll leave it be. Welcome to Rhodes Island.
[name="Dobermann"]     Let's just say that every moment of every day, your actions will affect the people around you, and the people around you will make decisions about your actions.
[name="Dobermann"]     As long as you follow the rules, Rhodes Island is tolerant of you, no matter what your past is.
[name="Dobermann"]     Instead, listen, operator Flamebringer, if you do anything even remotely out of line...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Hmm.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]      Next, I'll take you to the medical department. Someone wants to see you.
