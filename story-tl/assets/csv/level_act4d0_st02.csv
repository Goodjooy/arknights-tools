,Reunion Movement Caster,W，我们遇到了点麻烦。,"W, we have a problem.",
,W,嚯......值得你们用这个频道联系我，怎么？发现了什么有趣的事情？,Ho... For you to contact me on this channel. Why? What did you found that was interesting?,
,Reunion Movement Caster,不太有趣，W，在你重整那些萨卡兹雇佣兵的时候，有一支队伍叛逃了。,"Not that interesting, W. One of the teams went AWOL while you were reorganizing those Sarkaz mercenaries.",
,Reunion Movement Caster,好像是支负责清扫战场的后勤队伍，所以我们直接发起了追击。,"I seems to be a clean up team that was supposed to get rid leftovers from the battlefield, so we launched a pursuit.",
,Reunion Movement Caster,意料之内的，他们变成了一盘散沙，一触即溃，开始向城外撤离。,"Surprisingly, they scattered, collapsing their team, and began to evacuate the city.",
,W,可喜可贺。,Congratulations.,
,Reunion Movement Caster,但，意料之外的情况是......我们派去追击的小队，和我们失去了联系。,But the unexpected thing is... The team we sent in pursuit lost contact with us.,
,Reunion Movement Caster,作为佣兵们的新领头人，希望你能给出合理的解释。,"As the new leader of the mercenaries, I hope you can give me a reasonable explanation.",
,Reunion Movement Caster,我们的小队为什么人间蒸发了？,Why did our team disappeared?,

,,01:13 P.M.    天气/晴,,
,,切尔诺伯格，郊外，荒野,,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_1504_cqbw,W,这种描述可不利于我理解喔？,"Your kind of explanation is not good for my comprehension, you know?",
,Reunion Movement Caster,事实如此。协同小队没发现埋伏和陷阱，只知道敌人是萨卡兹人。,"That's true. But the team found no ambushes or traps, only that the enemy was a Sarkaz.",
char_1504_cqbw,W,那自然是萨卡兹了，我的佣兵还能有什么其他种族呢？不过，挺有趣的。接着说。,Of course it's Sarkaz. What other race are in my mercenary team? But that's interesting. Continue.,
,Reunion Movement Caster,最先接触的时候，目标被成功压制，出于谨慎，追击小队也有所保留。对方并不是什么强敌。,"At first contact, the target was successfully suppressed, and out of caution, the pursuit team held back since the other side was not a strong enemy.",
,Reunion Movement Caster,然而某个时刻，通讯突然中断了。,"At some point, however, communication was suddenly cut off.",
char_1504_cqbw,W,......嗯，比起你们，真正的野兽更善于隐藏自己的尖牙利齿，你们这也太大意了吧。,"... Well, it seems real beasts are better at hiding their fangs than you, you were too careless.",
,Reunion Movement Caster,我们该怎么办？,What should we do now?,
char_1504_cqbw,W,那些萨卡兹人有什么特点？,What's the distinguishing feature of that Sarkaz?,
,Reunion Movement Caster,......不清楚，目击者大都失去了联络。从远处看，只知道有一名近身陷阵的战士。,"... I don't know much. Witnesses are mostly out of contact. From a distance, only one soldier was known to be in close combat.",
char_1504_cqbw,W,那就不要和他们正面接触。拖住那个人，我们一会见。,Don't confront them head on. Delay that person. I'll see you later.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,出了什么事？,Did something happened?,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,没什么，只是有一支不够成熟的小队中了诱饵。,Nothing. It's one of the less mature teams has been baited.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,我们要去支援他们吗？,Are we going to support them?,
char_1504_cqbw,W,唉，明明大家都有自己的工作，为什么不能各自处理好分内的事情呢？,"Alas, clearly everyone has their own work to do, why can't each of them deal with the matter of duty?",
char_1504_cqbw,W,嗯......不过这次就不深究了吧。毕竟我也非常在意我可怜的前领导带着哪些奇怪的萨卡兹人呢。,"Hmm... I won't go deep into the matter this time around. After all, I'm also very concerned about the strange Sarkaz that my poor former leader had with him.",
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,明白了。,Understood.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,通知全体小队，临战整备，转移到城郊。,"Call all units, tell them to get ready, it's time to move to the suburbs.",

-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,呃，该死，这家伙的动作又变快了！他还在隐藏实力吗？,"Uh, damn, this guy's moving fast again! Is he still hiding his true strength?",
char_131_flameb_5#7,？？？,......太弱小了，所谓的整合运动只有这种水平吗？,... Too weak. Is this the only standard of Reunion Movement?,
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,你这家伙！竟然小看我们——,You bastard! How dare you actually underestimate us——,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,呵......,I see...,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,本来就预想到会遇上几个老熟人，可没想到会是你啊。,"I was expecting to meet some old acquaintances, but I didn't think it would be you.",
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,W，我们——,"W, we——",
char_1504_cqbw,W,归队，除非你想送死。别摆出那副急着报仇的表情，他还没有使出全力。哦，想送死的话，我就不拦着你咯？,"Stand back unless you want to die. Don't show that expression of impatience for revenge. He hasn't done his best yet. Oh, if you want to die, I won't stop you at all.",
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,......收队。,... Stand back.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,很久不见了，佣兵刀术师。,"Long time no see, sellsword master.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,你——,You——,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,现在，叫我W。,"Now, call me W.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,你呢？,How about you?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,炎客。你应该明白，于我而言，互报姓名的意义。,Flamebringer. You should understand what it means to me to exchange names.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,哎呀，可怕可怕，过去你手刃那些家伙的时候，也会互报姓名吗？,"Aiyah, how scary. Did you gave your name to those people you killed in the past?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,委托和厮杀是不一样的。,Comission is different from fighting.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,作为一个经历过那场战争的萨卡兹人忽然销声匿迹，很令人担心啊。,It was worrying for a Sarkaz who had lived through that war to suddenly disappear.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,佣兵嘛，只不过是换了个领头人就要跑路，让人很心慌喔？,"Mercenaries, just a change of leadership and then they want to run away, they're making people nervous.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,这无关紧要。,It doesn't matter.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,不过没想到，你的部下连让我报上名字的价值都没有。,But I didn't think that your men are not even worthy of hearing my name.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,那还真是荣幸......嗯，虽然他们成为我部下也没多长时间。啊，你是在邀请我杀了你？,"That's an honor... Well, they haven't been under me for very long. Oh, are you inviting me to kill you?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,不，我对你仰仗外力的战斗方式毫无兴趣。,"No, I'm not interested in the way you fight using tricks outside of true combat.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,但我得承认，战术也是一种技巧。如果你的战术比过去更加精湛，我愿意领教。,"But I must admit, tactics are a skill as well. If your tactics are better than what they used to be, I'd like to learn from you.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,......奇怪，你过去不是那种“只要杀了目标怎么都好”的类型吗？,"... Strange, weren't you used to be the ""just kill my target"" type?",
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,W，小队已经分散到了指定点，已经彻底切断了敌人的退路，他逃不掉的。,"W, the squad has been dispersed to the designated point, we've completely cut off the enemy's retreat, he can't escape.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我也没想到你能成为这些家伙的领导者，大家都在改变。,I didn't expect you to be the leader of these guys. It seems everyone is changing.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,这些家伙？啊......你是说整合运动？,These guys? Ah... You mean the Reunion Movement?,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,还是说......萨卡兹们？,Or say... Sarkaz's?,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,喝——！,Hurgh——！,
char_131_flameb_5#2,Flamebringer,唔。,Hmm.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,我是不会轻敌的，萨卡兹人，我注意你很久了。,"I don't underestimate the enemy, Sarkazian. I've been watching you for a long time.",
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,很可惜，你没有机会钻空子。,"A shame, you don't have a chance to take advantage of this.",
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,原来如此，你也是......,I see. So you are too...,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,这不是有意思多了吗，你能作为砥石为我所用吗？我的刀有些钝了。,Isn't this much more interesting? Can you be a whetstone for me? My sword has become a little blunt.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,挑衅？你也就现在能嚣张两下了！,Insults? You sure are arrogant now!,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,嗯，来吧。,Come get some.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,唔呃！该死！你是怎么——,Augh! Damn! How did you——,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,呃——！,Ahh——!,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,你还有空说话吗？,Do you still have some time to talk?,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,......意料之内，他变得更强了。,"... Not surprisingly, he became stronger.",
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,W！我们为什么就站在这里看着！？只要你下令，他立刻就会灰飞烟灭了！,"W! Why are we just standing here watching! ? If you give the order now, he'll go up in smoke!",
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,所以现在，我又能对你发号施令了？,So now I can give you orders?,
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,别在这种时候找茬！,Don't pick on us at such a time!,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,但我确实不是你们的指挥官呀。,But I'm not really your commander.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,提个建议，收手吧，别刺激他了，自找麻烦最好换个时间。,A piece of advice. Stop irritating him. It's better to ask for trouble at another time.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,......该死。,... Damn it.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,不是吧？你难道真的打算单打独斗就解决他？别在这里搞笑啊。,Are you serious? Are you really going to go at him alone? Don't be funny here.,
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,嘁。,Bah!,
char_131_flameb_5#2,Flamebringer,下一个是谁？,Who's next?,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,这么着急，是赶着去赴谁的约吗？,Are you in such a hurry to meet someone?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我不是第一次杀出重围了。,It's not the first time I've broke through.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,唔，嗯，原来如此。我想，你大概是在说内战时候的事吧？我有点兴趣，能说说吗？,"Well, well, I see. You're talking about the civil war, I suppose? I'm interested. Can you tell me more about it?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,没什么。被人埋伏，所有人死了而我还活着，就这么简单。,"It's nothing. There was an ambush, everybody's dead and I'm the only alive, it's as simple as that.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,怎么样？还要继续吗？,How's about it? Do you want to continue?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,对我来说，刚才的战斗还远远不够。,"To me, that fight was not enough.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,不......我在想，也许你应该加入我们。,"No... I was thinking, maybe you should join us.",
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,W！？他这个叛逃者，已经杀了那么多整合运动的——,"W! ? He, is a defector, he killed so many of the Reunion Movement——",
char_1504_cqbw#1,W,是我的佣兵们决定要用他，整合运动需要他。有意见？,It was my mercenaries who decided to use him. The Reunion Movement needs him. You're having opinions?,
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,你！,You!,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,......,...,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,不管怎么想，都是我们这边更有趣吧？战争，流血，还有那么多萨卡兹同僚......,"Either way, isn't our side more interesting? War, bloodshed, and so many of Sarkaz comrades...",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,你追求的一切在这里都是打折大放送哦。,Everything you're after is on sale here.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,当然，这份邀请也出于我个人的好奇心，我们一定有很多共同话题。,"Of course, this invitation is also out of my own personal curiosity, we must have a lot in common.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我不这么认为。,I don't think so.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,你也是感染者吧？加入整合运动又有什么不好呢？,You're infected? What's wrong with joining the Reunion Movement?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,无序的破坏，带着某种目的的集团暴行，我看不出能从这样的组织里得到什么。,I do not see what can be gained from joining such an organization as disorderly destructive and using mob violence with a certain purpose.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,战争？现在的你们不过是摩擦迸发出的点点火种，你应该知道真正的战争是什么样的。,"War? You're just a little spark of friction now, you should know what a real war looks like.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,别这么说，我们也是有在努力工作的，何况整合运动之间也有区别嘛。,"Come on, we're working hard over here, and there's a difference between the Reunion Movement.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,虽然我的前任上司喜欢更纯粹些的东西，但我可是无论什么都乐在其中啊。,"Although my former boss liked purer things, I find joy in everything.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,如果非要说的话......是呢，我想领教一下塔露拉的剑术。,"If I must say... well, I want to test Talulah's swordmanship.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,那个龙女？虽然我不想称赞她，但你基本没有一丁点胜算喔。,"That dragon woman? I don't want to praise her, but you're not even close to her level.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,而且她那个，能算剑术吗？你在靠近她之前就会变成一块炭吧？,"And her skill? Can that even be called swordsmanship? You'll be a lump of coal before you get near her, you know?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我知道。,I know.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,当然，我也知道，如果我拒绝你的条件，我突围的机会同样小之又小。,"Of course, I know that if I reject your offer, my chances of breaking through are just as slim.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,可这又何妨？只有在令人窒息的枷锁中挣脱，我才有可能更进一步。,But why does it matter? Only by breaking free of such suffocating shackles could I improve further.,
char_1504_cqbw#5,W,你......什么时候变得这么有情调了？,You...... When did you become so romantic?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我只是在寻求自己活着的意义。,I'm just looking for my own meaning in life.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,好吧，随你怎么说。不要管那个龙女了，单纯加入佣兵队伍如何？,"Well, whatever you say. Never mind that dragon woman, how about simply joining the mercenary team?",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,老工作的话，你也能更加得心应手吧。再说了，你不喜欢的上司，已经死了哦。,"You'll be better at your old job, too. Besides, the boss you don't like is dead.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,你并不值得信任。你我都互相隐瞒了很多事情。,You can't be trusted. You and I hide a lot from each other.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,......呵，有一个很不错的地方，那里比整合运动更适合磨砺我的刀刃。,"... Oh, there's a better place to sharpen my edge than Reunion Movement.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,我看到了。不久之前，我看到你和那个外来的萨卡兹人交易的场面。但除此之外，他们的战斗令我心动。,"I saw it. Not long ago, I saw you fighting against that outsider Sarkaz. But other than that, I was thrilled by their fight.",
char_1504_cqbw#5,W,还有这种事？！,You saw?!,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,就算他最后被你除掉了，事实就是事实，依然在那里。遮掩是没用的。,"Even if you got rid of him in the end, the truth is the truth. It's still there. Covering up is pointless.",
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,唔。,Hmm.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,真是败给你啦！行啦行啦。我确实和他口头约定好，让他干掉我的上司，方便我去做事呢。,"I really lost to you! Okay, okay. I did make a verbal pact with him to get rid of my boss so I could do my job.",
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,毕竟大家也是老相识了嘛，面子也是要卖一个的。,"After all, we are also old acquaintances, he had to let me.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,但你不可能放过他们。,But you can't let them go.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,至少我放过了他想保护的人啊。,At least I let go the people he was trying to protect.,
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,我答应他，会给罗德岛的救援队提供帮助——这和我杀死他这件事，也没什么矛盾吧？,"I promised him I would help the Rhodes Island rescue team——it doesn't contradict me killing him, I think?",
char_1504_cqbw#4,W,再说了，我也有自己的规划，钓线总要放长一些才行。但手上的猎物，也没理由让他跑了。,"Besides, I had my own plan. The bait line had to be longer. But there was no reason to let him run, he was prey.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,就算这样，他也消灭了你好不容易弄到手的精英战士。,"Even so, he's eliminated the elite warriors you've had a hard time getting.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,够了！这事，我可还是很生气的！,Enough is enough! I'm still very angry about it!,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,唉。难得遇到一位旧识，本来还以为能搞好关系，最后还是你死我活，我也很伤心的。,"Alas. It was hard to meet an old acquaintance, and I thought I could get along well with him. I'm sad that it had to end up like this.",
char_1002_nsabr_2,Reunion Movement Swordman,......W，我们必须动手了。拖得太久会影响既定的计划。,"... W, we have to start. Any further delays will affect the established plan.",
char_1504_cqbw,W,好啦，既然大家时间都很紧迫......你真的不打算改变你的看法？,"Okay, since everyone is pressed for time... Are you really not going to change your mind?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,自然不会。,Of course not.,
char_1504_cqbw,W,最后一个问题，你现在的雇主是谁？啊，抱歉，反正你是不会说的吧。,"Last question, who is your present employer? Oh, I'm sorry, you're not going to tell me anyways.",
char_1504_cqbw,W,但我大致猜得到。,But I have a rough guess.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,是吗，我以为他们没有那么有名。,Really? I thought they weren't that famous.,
char_1504_cqbw,W,我有不少旧识在那里。欸，虽然我的旧识到处都是啦，你也算是呢。,"I have a lot of old friends there. Well, even though I've got a lot of old acquaintances, you count too.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,前言不搭后语。,You're being incoherent.,
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,不，我要说的是，我也许清楚一些你以前的佣兵队伍被消灭的内幕。,"No, what I'm saying is, I may know something about the death of your old mercenary unit.",
char_1504_cqbw#3,W,尊敬的刀术师队长，策划了那次的阴谋，让你变成现在这样子的人，说不定就在你要去的地方哦？,"Dear captain of the sword division, who plotted that conspiracy to make you the person you are now, maybe that is where you need to go?",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,是吗？,Is that so?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,是吗......,Is that so...,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,有趣。,Interesting.,
char_1504_cqbw#5,W,啊哈哈，原来你不知道！当然了，我也是刚刚才知道。,"Aha, so you don't know! Of course, I just found out about it.",
char_1504_cqbw#5,W,很快你就会发现，事情肯定没你想的那么简单。,You will soon discover that things are not as simple as you think.,
char_1504_cqbw#5,W,我很期待你会怎么做，呵呵，你总会做些什么的。,"I am looking forward to what you will do, hehe, you will always do something.",
char_1011_wizard_1,Reunion Movement Caster,W！你还要等到什么时候！？,W! How long will you wait? ?,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,......,...,
char_1504_cqbw#1,W,哎，说真的，我的萨卡兹们不会动手哦？要干活，你们自己去干。,"Oh, seriously, my Sarkazian don't know how to just do it? If you need the work done. Do it yourself.",
char_1504_cqbw#1,W,刀术师——不，炎客，在之后的战斗里，你可能会死。,"Swordmaster - no, Flamebringer, you may die in the battle that follows.",
,Flamebringer,久违的死局。我很兴奋。,It's been a long awaited time for a game of death. I'm excited.,
,W,久违的？这么说来，也许你佣兵队的全灭并没让你变得冷酷，反而让你变得快乐起来了？,"Long awaited? So maybe the demise of your mercenary squad didn't make you colder, but made you joyful instead?",
,Flamebringer,我和你没有相像之处，W，快乐不是值得追求的目标。,,
,Flamebringer,“上一次”让我失去了很多东西，但我眼前的道路却变得明晰而清澈。,"""Last time"" made me lose a lot of things, but the road before me has become clearer.",
,Flamebringer,这一次，希望你们不要让我失望。,"This time, I hope you don't disappoint me.",
,W,你居然在笑哎。,You're laughing.,
,W,如果我说这次会饶你一命，你信吗？,"If I say I'll spare your life this time, do you believe me?",
,Flamebringer,我，也想这么问。,"I, want to ask that as well.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,合同内容——似乎没有要求你在正式登舰前，就和整合运动正面冲突。,Contract content——it doesn't seem to require you to confront the Reunion Movement before you actually get on board of Rhodes Island.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,是我个人的原因。,It's for my personal reason.,
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,我们欢迎感染者和有志于解决感染者问题的各类人才，但绝不接纳违反规则和条例的人。,"We welcome those who are infected and those who are interested in solving the problem of infected people, but we will never accept those who violate the rules and regulations.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,鉴于我们并不知道当时的具体情况，就不把这件事纳入考察了。,"Since we don't know what actually happened at the time, we won't take it into account.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,下不为例。,Just this once.,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,如果有必要，就按你们的方式处理。,"If necessary, I accept handling of your way.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,我们已经处理过了。你的动机和个人诉求，我们不会纳入考量——不如说。,"We've taken care of that. Your motives and personal aspirations, we won't take it into account——let's be clear.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,如果判断你是罗德岛无法接纳的人，那么即使你既高尚又正直，我们也不能网开一面。,"If we judge you to be an unacceptable person to Rhodes Island, even if you are noble and honest, we cannot afford to let you off the hook.",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,是的，仅仅是我的个人诉求。,"Yes, it's just my personal request.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,哼，不管这个，欢迎来到罗德岛。,"Well, we'll leave it be. Welcome to Rhodes Island.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,这么说吧，你的行为每时每刻，都会影响到身边干员，身边的干员也会针对你的行为作出决策。,"Let's just say that every moment of every day, your actions will affect the people around you, and the people around you will make decisions about your actions.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,只要你遵守规则，罗德岛会十分宽容地对待你，无论你的过去怎么样。,"As long as you follow the rules, Rhodes Island is tolerant of you, no matter what your past is.",
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,相反，听着，干员炎客，只要你做出哪怕一丁点出格的事情......,"Instead, listen, operator Flamebringer, if you do anything even remotely out of line...",
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,唔。,Hmm.,
char_130_doberm_ex,Dobermann,接下来，我领你去医疗部门吧，有个人想见见你。,"Next, I'll take you to the medical department. Someone wants to see you.",
,PLAYER,——你是？,,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,......,...,
char_131_flameb_5,Flamebringer,你......,You...,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,PLAYER,抱歉，借过。,,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,......呵。,... Hmm.,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,真是这样。,So it is true.,
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,W，你还真是诚实啊......,"W, you are so honest...",
char_131_flameb_5#4,Flamebringer,看来活久一点，确实有些益处。,It seems that living longer does have some benefits.,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,,切尔诺伯格,Chernoborg,
,,我和你没有相像之处，W. 快乐不是值得追求的目标。,"I have nothing in common with you, W. Joy is not a goal worth pursuing.",
,,,——You are?,
,,,"I'm sorry, excuse me.",
