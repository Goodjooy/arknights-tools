[name="Liskarm"]    This is only the fifth turn shot.
[name="Liskarm"]    The final target transition slowed significantly and you still missed the effective kill point.
[name="Liskarm"]    If it was real combat, the enemy would had reacted and counter-attack you.
[name="Liskarm"]    How are you, Jessica, is this training too much for you?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]    Ha, ha, ha, *Breath*... No, no!
[name="Jessica"]    Please instruct me to keep practicing!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]    Your will is not bad, but forcing yourself is not good at all.
[name="Liskarm"]    Let's take a 10 minute break and get your breath back as soon as possible.
[name="Liskarm"]    Within this 10 minutes break, I'm going to emphasize once again the basic principles of using a handgun.
[name="Liskarm"]    Even on the battlefield, never forget these important lesson!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   Yes!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]    First of all, always ensure the stability and balance of your posture, no matter what terrain movement there is, your body posture can not relax!
[name="Liskarm"]    Keep your upper body down and focus on your center of gravity.
[name="Liskarm"]    Secondly, there must be disclipline in your Originium arts control and handling of your handgun.
[name="Liskarm"]    从手臂连接到铳械内部，精确地感知弹药的推送情况，然后激活铳芯开火。
[name="Liskarm"]    说起来轻松，但是需要细腻地进行源石技艺的持续触发。
[name="Liskarm"]    一旦出现了技艺紊乱，就很可能造成射击失误甚至铳械的损坏。
[name="Liskarm"]    The last is aiming at the target and moving again.
[name="Liskarm"]    In Black Steel's shooting theory, these are just the basics of the basics, as you should know by now, Jessica.
[name="Liskarm"]    So, you know what was the biggest problem with your shooting?
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   Er... Because I don't have enough practice, so my center of gravity is unstable and my speed of reaction is not fast, and then my Originium arts control is not good...
[name="Jessica"]   And... whenever I shoot, I always hesitated or relaxed my posture, causing me to never hit my intended target.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=5, ystrength=8, vibrato=30, randomness=30, block=true)]
[name="Jessica"]   Ahh, so I think I have a big problem in everything!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]    You are half right and half wrong.
[name="Liskarm"]    Jessica you're always trying to do everything at once, you're trying to be fast enough and you're trying to hit the target as accurately as possible.
[name="Liskarm"]    Before you know it, you'll hesitating on every step.
[name="Liskarm"]    Because of your urgency, your Originium arts control is the first to go haystack. Therefore, when you should be aiming at the enemy, you are instead conducting a control check inside your handgun.
[name="Liskarm"]    From here on, your shooting will have a problem.
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   undefined
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]    The first thing you need to do is get rid of all the aspects that you care too much about and focus on your fingertips first.
[name="Liskarm"]    Trust your partner and that your handgun will not deceive you.
[name="Liskarm"]    How you treat it will respond back in kind to you.
[name="Liskarm"]    The amount and speed of Originium arts control is not the key, remember, precision control and stability is the most important part.
[name="Liskarm"]    Come on, let's continue. Practice moving to three practice tables in succession and shoot quickly at multiple targets in front of you.
[name="Liskarm"]    Five more sets! Focus on the Originium arts control in hand!
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]    Good!

[name="Franka"]      Basic training, basic training, and more basic training, it's been three hours...
[name="Franka"]      Can I leave this sweaty training room?
[name="Franka"]      undefined
[name="Franka"]      undefined
[name="Franka"]      I think Jessica needs to train her confidence instead.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     Looking at the data from Black Steel, Jessica's numbers are middling.
[name="Liskarm"]     As one of the official operators in Rhodes Island, Jessica was certainly under pressure.
[name="Liskarm"]     Although it was a reconnaissance mission with Frostleaf and the others, it never hurts to be prepared.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      What if she is exhausted on the battlefield?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     ...
[name="Liskarm"]     She was afraid of being a burden to others and wanted to improve her fighting ability, so she came to me.
[name="Liskarm"]     After cleaning up Lungmen, we had to go back to Black Steel headquarters, so we didn't have much time to train with Jessica.
[name="Liskarm"]     I also tried to share more of my experience with her about the use of handguns, even if a little.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     For the lovely juniors, that's nice of you. 
[name="Franka"]     I thought you'd forgotten we had to go back to Black Steel.
[name="Franka"]     This trip is not only to report on our Lungmen mission, but also to conduct routine inspections.
[name="Franka"]     You're not gonna to prepare anything? Are you not afraid of a lower assessment?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     I've already prepared the files. I'm not just sleeping and relaxing in Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     Hey ~ how did you know I came back to sleep and hang out?
[name="Franka"]     Liskarm-senpai sure is a real caregiver.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     至于考核，如果评价降了要调走的话，我是不是就不用跟你—
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]    With all the exercises you've been doing with Jessica, I'm guessing it's just a lot of hard work and experience at best?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     ...
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]    比起在这里一遍一遍一遍的原地苦练—
[name="Franka"]    If it's a seminar on guns, why not look for that shinning Exusiai?
[name="Franka"]    They are the true masters of guns. Bang ~ bang! Jessica could learn a trick or two from them better than she could from you.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     If you ask them, they just reply, ["What's so hard about this? It's as easy as walking."] or [Can't you do it just by feeling?]. Those were their replies.
[name="Liskarm"]     For angels who are adept at using various guns, a handgun is a child's toy to them.
[name="Liskarm"]     Laterano guns are too advanced and complex. There is little value to study them.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]       Hey, that's really enviable.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]       We need to master the fine Originium arts control in situations of rapid change, which no amount of ordinary training can easily be achieved.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     为什么创建黑钢的老板们，非要让下面的人使用这种费力不讨好的武器。
[name="Franka"]     It is a long range combat weapon, which is more difficult to operate than a crossbow. Ammunition is also more expensive and difficult to maintain.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]    Black Steel's choice of pistol is not unreasonable.
[name="Liskarm"]    Standard weapons make it easier for the company to manage the risk and staff changes, and they can also screen out mediocrity.
[name="Liskarm"]    In combat, it not only kept the rate of fire and efficiency, but also makes it easier to carry and hide than other long-range weapons.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      Okay, okay, okay, I don't want to hear any more of this.
[name="Franka"]     I understand now, you continue yours, if there's nothing then I'll go back.
[name="Franka"]     I'll be rooting for Jessica in my heart. I need more rest before I go back to Black Steel headquarters.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]        I didn't asked you to come here just for a chat. Jessica needs your help too.
[name="Liskarm"]    I can't teach her how to attack with high speed and use Originium arts on the front line.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      You could teach her to wield a big shield and fire and move.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]      别贫了。 
[name="Liskarm"]      比起我的建议，你的经验肯定更能够帮助到杰西卡才对。
[name="Liskarm"]      在作战前线来回移动，轻松突破敌人防御，还能长时间维持源石技艺强化武器。
[name="Liskarm"]      在黑钢之中还有谁能在源石技艺的控制上比得过你。
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]       停停停，为什么你老是能自然的说出来这些话。
[name="Franka"]       我听着都要脸红了。
[name="Franka"]      Whew, it's not impossible for me to teach Jessica. But I don't know how to be a teacher.
[name="Franka"]      如果理解不了我说的，跟不上我的节奏的话，我可不会慢慢地手把手教。
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]        Of course, Jessica hopes so.

[name="Franka"]      ......你刚才给我的这份杰西卡考核资料，你有看过吗？
[name="Liskarm"]        怎么，我还没有看过。数据真的很糟糕吗？
[name="Liskarm"]        杰西卡明明那么努力了......
[name="Franka"]       你仔细看看这些，木头脑袋。
[name="Franka"]       虽然杰西卡没有任何一项数据在黑钢内能排进前列，但是比起综合数据来说，杰西卡可一点不比我们差多少啊。
[name="Franka"]       不管杰西卡自己多没有自信，这可不是一个差生的数据。
[name="Franka"]       长久的训练和坚持，可绝对不会辜负付出努力的人。
[name="Liskarm"]      这......我一点都没有发现这些。
[name="Franka"]    你啊，别把木头脑袋也教给了杰西卡就好了。
