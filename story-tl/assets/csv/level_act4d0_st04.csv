,,叙拉古天灾低发区，荒野，某林中小屋,,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,唔......？,What...?,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......,...,
char_279_excu_4#6,？？？,我已经听见了歌声，躲藏是不必要的，我没有恶意。,I heard the song. It is unnecessary for you to hide. I mean no harm.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......每个刽子手都是这么说的。但最后，总是见血。,,
char_279_excu_4#6,？？？,刽子手？我不明白你的用词。我是拉特兰公证所——,Killer? I don't understand your words. I'm from Laterano and a notary——,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,闭嘴！你骗不了我！,Shut up! You can't fool me!,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,得手了！,Got you!,
char_279_excu_4#6,？？？,并没有。,Nope.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,咦？！,What?!,
char_279_excu_4#6,？？？,失礼了。,Excuse my lack of manners.,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,目标翻窗逃走，反应相当迅速。,"The target escaped through the window, they reacted quickly.",
char_279_excu_4,？？？,环境确认。腌制的羽兽肉，鞣制用的架子，处理过的牙兽皮，手工小刀和木质工具。,"Confirmation of the environment. There are preserved feathers, tanning shelves, processed tusks, handmade knives and wooden tools.",
char_279_excu_4,？？？,放下弓。我清楚你的位置，你埋伏在窗后。,Put down the bow. I know where you are. You're lurking behind the window.,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,重申一遍，我对你没有恶意。,"Again, I bear you no ill will.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,——不行！,——I refuse!,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,你的警戒心很强。,You have a strong vigilance.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,尝尝这一箭！,Have a taste of this arrow!,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,抓，用手抓住了箭身？,You g-grabbed my arrow with your hand?,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,怎么会......你究竟是什么人！,How did... Who the hell are you?!,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,诚如报告所说，遗嘱继承人暴躁排外，难以交流。,"Just as the report said, the heir to the will is irascible and a difficult person, and also hard to talk with.",
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,,以上就是本人遗嘱的全部内容。,As mentioned in the will.,
,,除此之外，我有一条出于私心的请求。,"In addition to this, I have a selfish request.",
,,在叙拉古的森林之中，我遇到了一位独臂的沃尔珀少女。,In the forests of Syracuse I met a one-armed Vulpus maiden.,
,,她沉溺在对过去的复仇之中，拘泥于那片染血的土地。,"She was obsessed with revenge for the past, clinging to that bloodsoaked land.",
,,出于怜悯，我帮助了她，也许这伤害到了她的自尊，但她倔强的求生方式的确感动了我。,"Out of pity, I helped her. Maybe it hurt her self-esteem, but her stubborn way of survival really touched me.",
,,后来我意识到，我一时兴起的援助，不过是坚定了她复仇的执念，这让我寝食难安。,"Then I realized that my impulse to help had only solidified her obsession with revenge, I couldn't sleep when I realized what I've done.",
,,所以我想把我的一切赠送给她，尽管我几乎一无所有，只剩那么点可悲的遗物。,"So I wanted to give her everything I had, even though I had almost nothing but a few sad momentos.",
,,——恕我打断一下，您的亲属列表里没有沃尔珀人。这会为我们的工作带来很多麻烦。,"——With all due respect, there are no Vulpus listed on your list of relatives. This will bring a lot of trouble to our work.",
,,所以，这只是一位膝下无子的拉特兰公民，在将死之际向公证所提出的小小请求。,That's why this is a small request from a childless citizen of Laterano to a notary on my deathbed.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......,...,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,（他的身上，有血的气味，而且，有股讨厌的感觉......）,"(He has the smell of blood on him and, what's more, he gives me a nasty feeling... )",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,（又是来破坏我们家园的人吗，讨厌，好讨厌！）,(Is it the people who are trying to destroy my home again?),
char_190_clour,Vermeil,上钩了！,He took the bait!,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,原来如此，又是个陷阱。似乎各个方位都有触发机关。,I see. Another trap. There seems to be a trigger in every direction.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,听着！你已经走进了猎人的陷阱，不想死的话，就把你的武器放下，一步也不要动！,"Listen! You're in a hunter's trap. If you don't want to die, drop your weapon. Don't move a step!",
char_279_excu_4,？？？,如果能方便交流，可以。,"If it helps with talking to you, sure.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你是什么人？,,
char_279_excu_4,？？？,拉特兰公证所的执行者，本次的遗嘱执行人。可以称呼我“送葬人”。,"The executor of Laterano notary, and the executor of this will. You can call me ""Executor"".",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,拉特兰......？,Laterano...?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,“红云”，你是被委托的对象。,"""Vermeil"", you are the one entrusted with this will.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你为什么会知道我的名字？,How did you know my name?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,你的名字由遗嘱人迪伦马特先生告知。,"Your name was given to me by Mr.Dürrenmatt, the testator.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我不认识这个人。,I don't know this person.,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,出于某些原因，他曾使用多个化名。,"Due to reasons, he used multiple aliases.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你要带我去哪里？,Where are you taking me?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,出于保密要求，我不能说。,"For reasons of confidentiality, I can't say.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......嘁，满嘴谎话！你就死在这里吧！,"... *Clicks her tongue*, you're full of lies! You'll die here!",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我是不会离开这儿的，我的爸爸妈妈，叔叔阿姨，还有朋友，我的族人，都，都......,"I'm never leaving here, my mom and dad, my aunts and uncles, my friends, my people are, are...",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我的任务只是带你离开。,My job is just to get you out of here.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,不要再说胡话了！你知道自己的处境吗！,Stop talking nonsense! Do you know your situation?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我处在无法进行交涉的情况下。,I'm in a situation where I am unable to talk with you.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,哼，走进这片森林的，都只会是我们的猎物。,"Humph, trespassers who walk into this forest, will only be our prey.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你的脚下的骨头，原本都是些野兽和坏人！,The bones under your feet were originally beasts and bad people!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,理解。据点周围布满陷阱。,Understood. Your home is surrounded by traps.,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,落穴，绊索，土制地雷，自动飞镖。,"Pit, tripwire, landmines, automatic darts.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,请放心，我已经全部解除了。陷阱很初级，有伤到委托对象你的可能性。,"Please rest assured that I have disarmed them all. The trap were very basic, there is no possibility of injuring you.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......,...,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,请跟我走。,Please come with me.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,——！走开！,——！Go away!,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,再往前一步，我就射穿你！,"One more step, and I'll shoot you through!",
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_279_excu_4,Executor,又逃了。,She fled again.,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_190_clour,Vermeil,喂，你为什么要救我？,"Hey, why did you save me?",
,Old Hunter,毕竟我也是个猎人。,"I'm a hunter too, after all.",
,Old Hunter,看到一位可敬的同行失去了一只臂膀，血肉模糊地躺在一只牙兽的身边，我怎么能视而不见呢？,"How could I turn a blind eye to the sight of a worthy fellow hunter lying mangled next to a toothed beast, with an arm missing?",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,哼......你根本不是猎人，你骗不了我。你身上没有泥土的味道。,Hmph... You're no hunter. You can't fool me. You don't smell of dirt.,
,Old Hunter,哈哈，瞒不过你，但亲眼目睹那副景象的时候，我被年幼却征服了荒野的你感动了，这是实话。,"Haha, I can't hide it from you, but when I witnessed that sight, I was moved by you who conquered the wilderness with you being so young, that's the truth.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,那是什么意思？,What did you say?,
,Old Hunter,只是我的自言自语。,It's just me talking to myself.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你脑袋上的那个圆，还有背后的装饰，是怎么回事？,What is with the circle on your head and the decoration on your back?,
,Old Hunter,小家伙，你没见过拉特兰人吗？,"Kid, you never seen a Lateranian (Laterano) before?",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,嗯。,Yeah.,
,Old Hunter,这是......我抛却的故土给我留下的印记。,This is... The mark of my homeland I left behind.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,人是没法抛弃家的泥土的。,I don't believe a person could abandon their homeland.,
,Old Hunter,也许吧，总之，发生了很多事，来，试着站起身来吧。,"Maybe you're right. Anyways, a lot of things happened in the past. Come on, try to get up.",
,Old Hunter,让我来帮你装上这个。,Let me help you install this.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,这是......？胳膊？铁做的胳膊？好奇怪的东西。,This is... ? An arm? Iron arm? What a strange thing.,
,Old Hunter,代表我对一位荒野之子的敬意。,In honor of a child of the wilderness.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你是个修东西的？,You're a repairman?,
,Old Hunter,很久以前的职责让我学会了很多东西。,I learned a lot from my work a long time ago.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......,...,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......你救过我，你不是个坏人。为了报仇，我很需要一只胳膊，谢谢。,"... You saved me. You're not a bad guy at all. I need an arm for revenge, so thank you.",
,Old Hunter,复仇吗......我不会指点你的命运。,Revenge huh... I will not tell you what to do.,
,Old Hunter,但当你用这只手臂拉动弓弦的时候，你可以想想，除了报仇以外，我们是为什么活着。,"But when you pull your bowstring with this arm, you can think about why we live, other than revenge.",
,Old Hunter,想得少了，就会沦落到我今天这样。,"If you thought about it less, you'll end up where I am today.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我——,I——,
,Old Hunter,不要说什么“为了复仇而活”，这太老套了，很没意思的。,"Don't say ""I live for revenge"". It's such a cliche. It's not worth it.",
,Old Hunter,......没错，很没意思的。,"... Yeah, it's not worth it.",
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_190_clour,Vermeil,（拉特兰......他说他是拉特兰人......）,(Latera... he said he's Lateranian (Laterano)...),
char_190_clour,Vermeil,（难道他真的是......),(Is he really...),
char_190_clour,Vermeil,唔！又来，好痛！,"Urgh! Again, it hurts!",
char_279_excu_4#3,Executor,看来迪伦马特先生的判断是正确的。,It seems that Mr.Dürrenmatt is right.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,什么？,What?,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,可恶，你是什么时候追到这里的？,Damn it. When did you get here?,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,唔！放开我！！,Argh! Let me go!!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,停手吧，既然你是遗嘱继承人，我就不能伤害你。,"Please stop resisting. Since you're the heir to the will, I can't hurt you.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,这是他的信。,This is his letter.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,——！！,——！！,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,为什么还要抵抗？,Why are you still resisting?,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......信上有他的气味，血的气味，你对他做了什么！？,"... The letter smells of him, smells of blood, what did you do to him! ?",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,从拉特兰抵达这里的旅程非常漫长，气味分子不可能有所保留。,"The journey from Laterano is quite far, it's impossible for you to still smell the scent molecules.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,回答我！否则你会死在这里！,Answer me! Or you'll die here!,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,呃！,Urgh!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,首先，我认为展示力量差距有助于对话成立。,"First of all, I think it's time to show the power gap between us for us to talk.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,其次，出于对遗嘱继承人的尊重，我可以回答你。,"Secondly, out of respect for being the heir to the will, I shall answer your question.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,迪伦马特先生死在手术台上，并不安详。他身患一种无法治愈的疾病。,"Mr.Dürrenmatt did not past away peacefully on the operating table, he was suffering from an incurable disease.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你——！松手！,You——! Let go!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,这是他的选择。,It was his choice.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,喂！你，你在干嘛！,Hey! What are y-you doing?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,源石已经破体而出，感染程度在加剧。,"Oripathy has spread through your body, the degree of infection is increasing.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,这不关你事！,It's none of your business!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,如果执行对象坚持拒绝，原则上，我可以放弃。,"If the recipient target insists on rejecting, in principle, I can give up.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,但委托人和上司给予了我一个附属条约，我必须执行。,But my client and boss have given me a subsidiary condition that I must execute my job.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,——你到底要怎么样？,——What do you want?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,“让红云活下去”。,"""Let Vermeil live on.""",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,但因为要求笼统，所以实行起来很复杂，希望你能配合。,"But because the requirement is so general, carrying it out is actually very complex, I hope you can cooperate with me.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......这也是那个人的委托？,...Is this part of your client's request?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,是的。他变卖了所有的财产，支付了包括公证所的额外手续费，以及你将来的治疗开销。,"Indeed. He sold all his possessions away, paid the notary office extra fees, and your future medical bills.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,可是，为什么？他只是路过这片森林......,But why would he do that? He was just passing through this forest...,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,他想让你活下去。,He wants you to live.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,所以我问为什么！,That's why I'm asking!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,因为他觉得你值得活下去。,Because he thinks you have a life worth living.,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,既然遗嘱已经传达到位，我的工作就告一段落了。,"Now that the will is known, my work is done.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,什......！你什么时候塞给我的——！,What...! When did you give me this——!,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,在下一步行动前，我必须听到你的答复。,"Before we move onto the next step, I need to hear from you first before I do my job any further.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,“你想活下去吗？”,"""Do you want to live?""",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......,...,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,你只要回答，想，或是不想。,You only need to answer me a yes or no.,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我们的时间不多。,We don't have much time.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我——,I——,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,,对了，先生，我该怎么称呼你？,"By the way, Mister, what should I call you?",
,,——送葬人。如果你执意要称呼我的话。,——Executor. If you must.,
,,非常感谢你愿意接受我的委托。,Thank you very much for accepting my request.,
,,——是中庭公证所做出了决定，我只是履行职责。,——It was the atrium notary who made the decision. I was just doing my job.,
,,哈哈，也是。在你寻找红云的过程中，我还有一个小小的请求。,"Haha, that's true. In your search for Vermeil, I have a small request.",
,,——视情况，我可能会拒绝你的口头诉求。希望你以纸面申请的形式递交公证所。,"——depending on the circumstances, I may decline your verbal request. We hope that you can submit your application to the notary office on paper.",
,,先生可真是不留情面，没关系，只是一个小小的要求。,"That's not very kind of you, Mister. It's all right though. It's only a small request.",
,,不要告诉她关于我的过去，随便编个借口吧，比如，我死在了手术台上？,"Don't tell her about my past, just make up some excuse, like, I died on the operating table?",
,,——我不明白这其中的必要性，这也不符合你的身份。你逃避公证所多年，而且你枪杀了......,"——I don't understand the necessity of it, and it's not in keeping with your status. You dodged notaries for years, and you shot and killed...",
,,打住。如果我说，这能为你的工作省去很多麻烦呢？,"Hold on. What if I said, this could save you a lot of trouble in your job?",
,,——如果我判断的确如此的话，我会考虑尝试。,"——If I judge that to be the case, I will consider trying it.",
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
char_190_clour,Vermeil,......所以，那个叫罗德岛的地方，真的能治疗这种奇怪的病？,"... So, that place, Rhodes Island, can really treat this strange disease?",
char_279_excu_4#5,Executor,没有人能够抵抗矿石病。但也许可以缓解痛苦。,No one can resist Oripathy. But it might ease the pain.,
char_279_excu_4#5,Executor,考虑到你先前对那些乌萨斯人所做的一切，我不建议你单独行动。,"Considering what you did to those Ursus, I don't recommend you go alone.",
char_279_excu_4#5,Executor,而我正好要去罗德岛履行另一份协议。,And I happened to be on my way to Rhodes Island to fulfill another agreement.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你是在邀请我和你同行？,Are you inviting me to go with you?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我认为这十分合理。,I think that's quite reasonable.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,哼，我拒绝。,"Well, I refuse.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我还有很多事情要做，在离开这片土地之前，我要与族人们道别。,"I still have a lot of things to do. Before I leave this land, I want to say goodbye to my people.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,这里很危险，仇恨并不会因为一方的妥协而终结。,It's dangerous here. Hatred doesn't end even when the other side gives in.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,哼......你知道得很清楚。,,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,无论你怎么说，别妨碍我。等到一切结束，我会去那个......罗德岛的，这样就行了吧？,"Whatever you say, don't get in my way. When it's done, I'll be going there... Rhodes Island, is that all?",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我在考虑。,I'm thinking.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,什么？,What?,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,考虑如果那些亡命之徒再次找到你，我的子弹储备是否充足。,Considering whether I have enough bullets if those desperadoes find you again.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,子弹......？不，你的意思是要陪着我回到荒漠！？,"Bullets... ? No, you mean to accompany me back to the desert! ?",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,根据你的回答，你已被公证所视作接受遗嘱。,"According to your answer, you have been recognized as accepting the will.",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,但遗嘱内容尚未履行完成，我不能放任你就这么暴露在危险中。这是我的义务。,"But the contents of the will have not been fulfilled yet, so I cannot leave you in harms way. It's my duty to protect you.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,我不需要你的帮助！我一直都是一个人——,I don't need your help! I've always been alone——,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,以及，我认为你有故意妥协，然后趁机逃走的可能。,And I think there's a chance you're compromising and then planning to run away.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,啧。,Damn.,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,那么事不宜迟，我们出发吧。,"Then without further ado, let's go.",
char_190_clour,Vermeil,喂！我没有答应你！我不需要你这种外人来......等等，你要去哪儿？你怎么知道那个方向的！？,"Hey! I didn't promise you! I don't need an outsider like you... Wait, where are you going? How do you know that direction! ?",
char_279_excu_4,Executor,调查的结果。,Investigation results.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,你脚下有——,Under your feet there's a——,
char_279_excu_4,Executor,我已经解除了陷阱，请跟上。,I've cleared the trap. Follow me.,
char_190_clour,Vermeil,啊啊——你这个怪人，我迟早要让你好看——！,"Arghhhh——you weirdo, I'll get you sooner or later——!",
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,,请一定要照顾好她，送葬人先生。当然，也许对你而言也是一件好事。,"Please take care of her, Mr. Executor. Of course, maybe it will be a good thing for you, too.",
,,别摆出一副不理解的表情，你会明白的。,Don't look like you don't understand. You'll understand someday.,
,,希望你们能让她脱离泥泞。别让她像我一样。,I hope you can get her out of that place. Don't let her end up like me.,
,,正义？也许我的所作所为是有正当性的吧，先生，如果公证所能够谅解我的话。,"Justice? Perhaps I have done right, Sir, if the notary will excuse me.",
,,但那依旧不是什么值得称赞的事情，相反，正因如此，才让人生显得荒谬之极。,"But that's still not a laudable thing. On the contrary, it's what makes life seem ridiculous.",
,,但她是我的遗产。,But she's my legacy.,
,,是我的希望。,She is my hope.,
,,愿主保佑。,God bless.,
-----,-----,-----,-----,-----
,,......每个刽子手都这么说的。但最后，总是见血。,"... That's what every killer says. But in the end, there's always bloodshed.",
,,你是什么人？\,Who are you? \,
,,哼......你知道的很清楚。,Humph... You do know about it.,
