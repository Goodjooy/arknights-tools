[Character]
Unknown named operator, hide yourself well. I didn't had the chance to look at your tag and remember your name
There's not enough time, while my writing may be messy, please understand and continue to read on.
Don't panic, you are safe for the time being.
Please do not walk out of this ruin. The enemy has a good chance of finding you before the sun sets.
You are, so to speak, surrounded by the enemy.

[name="Hellagur"]   I, Barclay, and Semyon would had all died at the hands of Kazimierz's Sliver Spear Pegasus if you had not charged into the fort with your shield weathering the storm.

[name="Patriot"]   Oripathy, changed my vocal chords. Now, I have a hard time, talking. Funny, isn't it?

[name="Patriot"]   Is that so?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Nothern guerrilla... team leader is actually you. Out of the dozen Wendigoes, I never thought it could had been you.
[name="Hellagur"]   Blue beard Alyosha, of that calvary division, once made a bet with me that you are a natural born Ursus soldier who will rise up to Marshal.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I'm just a captain, general. Times have changed.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   ...That's not funny. Your loyalty, your military service, and your battle planning in the meetings... You're one of the best field commanders in Ursus.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   You give me too much praise. Besides, I'm a Sarkaz, after all.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   If even you couldn't be Field-grade Officer, then almost all of Ursus top ranking military officers should be sent to the Royal court.
[name="Hellagur"]   Although, almost all of them are dead.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Then I, have outlived them. Most of your comrades, are also gone.
[name="Patriot"]   And, his Majesty once said, a soldier serves his country, not his rank.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   But he also said that what binds the Ursus people together is faith, not by blood. The present? May his Majesty rest in peace.
[name="Hellagur"]   So the Emperor of today still treats your people as monsters, not brave Ursus soldiers. They have been suppressing you and your people.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   That, tolerant kind Emperor, is gone, I, understand it now.
[name="Patriot"]   Ursus, countless beasts of war, will covered this land whole, and I'm not that important.

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   ... I'll find out, who did it. What happened, at the clinic was unusual.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   No need. Rather, with you in the picture, it is less likely the Reunion Movement doing.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I'm not so sure. The Reunion Movement, is a little disorganized. There are gaps between us.
[name="Patriot"]   But general. You can, join the Reunion Movement.
[name="Patriot"]   Ursus, will be liberated. The infected and common folk, will get along equally.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   ...
[name="Hellagur"]   Look over there. See where my left hand side is? Do you see that building pierced by Originium?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I do.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   It used to be a mall, and the citizens who lived three blocks around it relied on its wares.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Natural disaster, destroyed Chernobog. It destroyed fortresses, and the city as well. I don't agree with the method, but it was necessary. I'm helpless to say.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   There was a time when colored lamps was tied to the top of its bell tower on one end and the other hung from the fence at the crossroads, each flickering bulb was warm with light.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   You want light bulbs that shines light, and I just want to build another mall. That's the difference between us.

[name="Patriot"]   ——Past you would never compromise like this.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Maybe. Rhodes Island may not be a promosing place, but I also have no feelings for this land. 
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   You just, don't want to fight against your country, general.
[name="Patriot"]   Look at this city, look at the infected, and look at the people who have been thrown into the Originium mines, waiting to die.
[name="Patriot"]   And you, you've never been one to fear a fight.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   That's right. If Ursus attacked us, we fight back.
[name="Hellagur"]   But the way the Reunion Movement fought back is not the same as me. Look at this city you're standing on——The Reunion Movement is waging war.
[name="Hellagur"]   How many people would die in a war? How many Ursus would be killed in a civil war?
[name="Hellagur"]   Ursus eating one another, Ursus slaughtering one another, Usus destroying one another.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]

[name="Patriot"]   If the parliament, has planned this, we shall overthrow them.
[name="Patriot"]   If the army, created opposition, then we shall destroy them.
[name="Patriot"]   Talulah has big ambitions. My goal, is in phases, but clear.
[name="Patriot"]   The Ursus of the past, war is just; Now the infected, war is just.
[name="Patriot"]   I fight for justice. Justice, belongs to Ursus forever.

[name="Scout"]   Please, witness their battle.
[name="Scout"]   If anyone asks, please answer them for me——
[name="Scout"]   Although no one can remember the names of my squad members, but they died with dignity. They did not shrink their duty in the face of death, they absolutely faced it head on.
[name="Scout"]   Of course, I know many Rhodes Island operators who gave their live to Rhodes Island cause. Not one death is special.
[name="Scout"]   It's just that we're not only fighting for any single life. To say so is to belittle their death!
[name="Scout"]   Remind anyone who asks: they all died for what they believed in.
[name="Scout"]   Third——
[name="Scout"]   You have to live for yourself, unknown named Rhodes Island brother. I'm not asking you to go die.
[name="Scout"]   Life is precious, if you can live to achieve your ideals, why die?
[name="Scout"]   I've written enough, brother.
[name="Scout"]   Cherish your life.
